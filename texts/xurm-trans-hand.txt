What is happening in Tuz Khurmatu!

While I believe that the strategy of the Shia in Iraq and their vision in Tuz Khurmatu, Daquq and Kirkuk is a full break with that dream that Kurds would create their own friendly connections with the Shia, in the strategic side the attempted process of Shiaization in those regions has remained half finished. Consequently in every related state and when they take action together, they are reminded of ISIS at Shengal, which they see closing on those regions!


It has been two months that the political situation with Baghdad has been degrading. Stress about the authority of #Baghdad is developing rank that authority *neçar wedding *bêyî own heart #some changes are seen. It is true that excuses like reform have been popular, but the main question is something else. I surmise that a side within #Iraq with international aid, wants a more independent #Baghdad than the #Baghdad of now.

It is clear that the state of Iraq has been following various sides. Baghdad is not independent and is being guided by various capitols. It is clear that #both in #Iraq and #both about the situation of the West of Kurdistan, there exists a notable hesitation toward the fragmentation of Iraq. Now there is an inclination for Iraqifying Baghdad. The things that now happen in #Baghdad are a struggle about its identity.

In #Baghdad everything that happens increases the stress and pressure. The terrible and slow state economy and political and administerial corruption make it tough for Iraqis that want an end to Shia rule. The Shia are faced with a considerable internal fragmentation. #Be *lêvegerê and #be  #Iran *nikarîbûn way before #this crack and *parçebûnê *bigirin. The future of Shia in Iraq and their influence are now connected to these events. Consequently "reasonable voices" are calling for both the shia and Baghdad to end the tensions..

It was almost two years ago that the Village *Beşîr in the outskirts of #Kirkuk came under occupation of ISIS and this was an excuse for strengthening the status of shia in the regions #Kirkuk and #Tuz Khurmatu. It was never logical that the army of #Iraq and militants of #Hashd al Shaabi should do inspections in the villages!

Kurds must proceed carefully. It is necessary that the Kurds like sides chief by fighting #ISIS and power *yekalîker in regions #Kirkuk, #ISIS to Village *Beşîr *derxînin. With #this colour  *metirsiya #ISIS about #Kirkuk and #Tuz Khurmatu and *Daquqê *nahêlin and excuse *mabûna Hashd al Shaabi and *çekdarên #Shia in region not #stay that majority #that *erebên process of Arabization of the age of Saddam #be.

Continuation of this state of affairs will strain the relations of Kurds and those regions. Paper stress  continuation  by Baghdad  and *kengî #want *dikare *bikar *bîne. Consquently Kurds must act with care and take paths to remove problems and questions and not make problematic tangles in the body of #Kurdistan .
